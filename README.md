# Valentine Proposal Webpage

This project is a static webpage designed to ask my girlfriend to be my valentine. The webpage will be hosted on GitHub Pages and will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features
- A simple and romantic UI theme with love-inspired colors.
- Two buttons: one for 'Yes' and one for 'No'.
- The 'No' button will be non-clickable and will move away when the cursor approaches it.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

## UI Theme
- Simple design with love colors (e.g., pink, purple).
- A romantic and cozy font will be used for the text.

## Button Details
- The 'Yes' button will contain the text 'Yes'.
- The 'No' button will behave as if it is being repelled by the cursor, moving away as if the cursor is a magnet with an opposite pole.

## Background Design
- A pink background with a paper sheet design where the questions and buttons will be displayed.

## Main Question
- The main question displayed on the page will be: "Will you be my valentine?"

## Questions for Planning
1. What specific love colors do you prefer for the UI?
2. Do you have a preferred font or style for the text?
3. Should the 'Yes' button have any specific text or design?
4. How should the 'No' button behave when the cursor approaches it? Should it move in a specific direction or have a specific distance?
5. Would you like any animations or transitions for the buttons?
6. Do you want to include any images or background elements on the page?
7. Is there any specific message or text you want to display on the page besides the buttons?
